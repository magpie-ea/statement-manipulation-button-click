          <b>Nature of the study.</b> You are invited to participate in a study which involves looking at sets of (fictitious) exam results. You will either be asked to describe these results, or to interpret other people’s descriptions of them. Once you finish, we may have also some questions about your experience (e.g., age, gender, language background). Your session should last for up to 20 minutes. You will be given full instructions shortly.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Compensation.</b> You will be paid £2.50 for your participation in this study.

In order to safeguard your privacy, we will never share personal information (like your name) with anyone outside the research team. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name). Please note that we will temporarily collect your participant ID to prevent repeated participation, however we will never share this information with anyone outside the research team. We will store any personal data (i.e., participant ID) securely using the University of Osnabrück’s storage systems. The anonymised data collected during this study will be used for research purposes and may be shared with other researchers or with the general public (e.g., we may make it available through the world wide web, or use it in TV or radio broadcasts).

Part of your job is to write a report on the results of standardized math exam questions. These results have been published for Green Valley and for your main rival, Riverside High School.
  <br/><br/>
  It's important that you don't tell any lies in the report, but you don't have to report objectively on the facts. <strong>Your aim is to make Green Valley sound like a school whose students have a high probability of success on the exam questions, and Riverside sound like a school whose students have a low probability of success.</strong>
  <br/><br/>
  In the following, you will be presented with tables showing the results of students who took a math exam for each high school.
  A  "<i style=color:#13AC38>  &#10004 </i>" indicates that a question was answered correctly, "<i style=color:#B12810> &#10008 </i>" that it was answered incorrectly.
  <br />
  <br />
  Given the information from the table, please choose the words to complete a given sentence, so that the resulting sentence best presents Riverside or Green Valley in the way described above.
  <br />
  <br />
  We will start with some training trials, before the actual experiment begins, so you can get used to the displays and the manner of forming sentences.`,

        Given the information from the table, you should present Riverside's results in such a way as to give the impression that Riverside has a low rate of success, and to present Green Valley's results to give the impression that is has a high rate of success</strong>, but avoid telling lies.`,
